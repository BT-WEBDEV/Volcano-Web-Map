# Volcano-Web-Map
Case Use: Simple volcano web map that displays the location of U.S. volcanos via an HTML file. Volcanos are in three different catagories. Green is the lower elevation, yellow a mid-tier elevation, and red the higher elevation group. The programming logic could be re-tooled for different sets of data to display on the map. The volcano dataset uses a JSON file. 

Modules Used: 
- Folium 
- Pandas

PLEASE READ THIS FIRST - The program will output a "TEST.HTML" file once "SCRIPT.PY" runs. This file will need to be opened on your browser. (I have included the TEST.HTML file within this repository, it will get overwritten once you run the script.)

To Run The Script:

Make sure you have Folium & Pandas installed. 

Run the Python script "SCRIPT.PY" within your terminal.  

Once the script has run, open the "TEST.HTML" file within you browser. 

Check out the different volcano locations!
